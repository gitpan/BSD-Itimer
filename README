BSD::Itimer allows you to access the interval timer many Unix systems
provide without resorting to non-portable syscalls.

This is version 0.8.  It has a very simple functional interface to the
get/setitimer functions.  Suggestions or code implementing a nicer
interface welcome; I can be reached as hag@linnaean.org .

BSD::Itimer is available from my home page,
http://www.linnaean.org/~hag/ , and your nearest CPAN mirror in
CPAN/authors/id/H/HA/HAG.

Version 0.8 has been tested on:

Linux 2.0.36
NetBSD 1.4
FreeBSD 2.2.6
SunOS 4.1.4
Solaris 2.6
IRIX 6.5
OSF/1 4.0
HPUX 10.10
